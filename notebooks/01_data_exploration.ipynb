      "================================================================================\n",
      "1. QUESTION: What is women's empowerment?\n",
      "   ANSWER: Women's empowerment refers to the process of giving women the power and authority to make life decisions, access resources, and participate fully in social, economic, and political life. It's about creating an environment where women can exercise their rights and achieve their full potential.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 1.000 | CATEGORY: basic_concepts | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "2. QUESTION: How can I support gender equality?\n",
      "   ANSWER: Men can support gender equality by sharing domestic responsibilities, advocating for women in workplaces, challenging toxic masculinity, supporting paternity leave, listening to women's experiences, and being active allies in fighting discrimination and harassment.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 0.794 | CATEGORY: actionable_advice | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "3. QUESTION: What is the gender pay gap?\n",
      "   ANSWER: The gender pay gap refers to the difference in average earnings between men and women. Globally, women earn about 20% less than men for similar work. This gap is influenced by factors like occupational segregation, discrimination, and caregiving responsibilities.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 1.000 | CATEGORY: workplace | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "4. QUESTION: Why is girls education important?\n",
      "   ANSWER: Educating girls is crucial because it leads to better health outcomes, economic growth, and social development. Educated women are more likely to educate their own children, participate in workforce, and make informed decisions about their health and lives.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 1.000 | CATEGORY: education | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "5. QUESTION: Tell me about reproductive rights\n",
      "   ANSWER: Reproductive rights include the right to decide if, when, and how to have children; access to contraception and safe abortion; quality maternal healthcare; and freedom from forced sterilization or pregnancy. These are fundamental human rights recognized internationally.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 1.000 | CATEGORY: health_rights | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "6. QUESTION: What is climate change?\n",
      "   ANSWER: Climate change disproportionately affects women because they often depend more on natural resources, have less access to resources during disasters, face increased care burdens, and are more vulnerable to climate-related health issues and displacement.\n",
      "   CONFIDENCE: 0.578 | CATEGORY: environment | SOURCE: knowledge_base\n",
